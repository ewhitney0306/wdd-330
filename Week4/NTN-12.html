    <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
    <h2>Three Parts of OOP</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
        </ol>
        <p>ENCAPSULATION - keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it’s done.</p>
        <p>POLYMORPHISM - various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p>
        <p>INHERITANCE - take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</p>
    <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>class Dice {
            constructor(sides=6) {
                this.sides = sides;
         }
    
            roll() {
                return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
            }
        }
        </p>
    <h2>Static Methods</h2>
        <p>called by the class directly rather than by instances of the class.</p>
        <p>Static methods are not available to instances of the class. </p>
    <h2>Prototypal Inheritance</h2>
        <p> every class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class. So any properties or methods of a class’s prototype can be accessed by every object instantiated by that class.</p>
    <h2>Prototype Property</h2>
        <p>augment the class with extra methods and properties after it has been created</p>
        <p>All classes and constructor functions have a prototype property that returns an object:</p>
    <h2>Using Classes and Prototypes to create Instances</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a class declaration that deals with any initialization, shared properties and methods.</li>
            <li>Any extra methods and properties that need to be augmented to the class declaration after it’s been defined can be added to the prototype. These will be added to all instances, even those that have already been created.</li>
            <li>Add any properties or methods that are individual to a particular instance can be augmented using assignment to that object (a mixin could be used to add multiple properties at once, as we’ll see later).</li>
            <li>Be careful when overwriting the prototype completely ― the constructor class needs to be reset.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Inheritance</h2>    
        <p>class NinjaTurtle extends Turtle {
            constructor(name) {
                super(name);
                this.weapon = 'hands';
            }
            attack() { return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!` } 
        }
        </p>
    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
        <p>different objects have the same method but implement it differently.</p>
    <h2>Monkey Patching</h2>
        <p> add more methods to the prototype of JavaScript’s built-in objects </p>
    <h2>Mixin</h2>
        <p>lets us encapsulate properties and methods in an object, then add them to other objects without the overhead of an inheritance chain being created.</p>
