    <h1>Modular Javascript</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to opt out of this.</li>
            <li>A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.</li>
            <li>The of this in th top level of a module is undefined rather than the globala object</li>
            <li>You can't use HTML-style comments in modules</li>
        </ul>
