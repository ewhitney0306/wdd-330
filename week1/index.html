    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <h3>Points to Ponder</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>How can I store data so it isnâ€™t lost when the application stops?</li>
        <li>How do I get data back into my application once it has been stored?</li>
        <li>What can I do to allow the user to communicate?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Computers are stupid.</p>
    <p>The &lt;input/&gt; tag is self closing and doesn't have a closing tag. I think it used to but with HTML5 it no longer does. 
        Not much to take notes on.</p>
